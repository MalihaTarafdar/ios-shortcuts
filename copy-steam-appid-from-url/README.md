## Get Steam AppID From URL v1.0

<u>Note</u>: If you are on iOS 14 or lower, you must allow untrusted shortcuts in order to import this shortcut. To find out how, see [https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/4.0/ios/14.0](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/4.0/ios/14.0). 

Install manually by saving `Copy Steam AppID From URL.shortcut`. Then, import it by opening the file. Alternatively, you may install via the [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f0453329059547d0b531ca0d2cc0709d). 

This shortcut gets the AppID of a Steam product when given its corresponding Steam URL and copies it to your clipboard. It may be used through the browser share sheet when visiting the site or manually where the URL must be pasted into the input dialog. 

This shortcut is intended to be used in conjunction with my [Steam Discount]((https://github.com/MalihaTarafdar/ios-shortcuts)) shortcut in order to get the AppIDs of your desired products to track. 

This shortcut along with others I have made are open source and can be found at [https://github.com/MalihaTarafdar/ios-shortcuts](https://github.com/MalihaTarafdar/ios-shortcuts).
