## Get Steam AppID From URL v1.0

This shortcut gets the AppID of a Steam product when given its corresponding Steam URL. It may be used through the share sheet when visiting the site or manually where the URL must be pasted into the input dialog. 

This shortcut is intended to be used in conjunction with my [Steam Discount]((https://github.com/MalihaTarafdar/ios-shortcuts)) shortcut in order to get the AppIDs of your desired products to track. 

This shortcut along with others I have made are open source and can be found at [https://github.com/MalihaTarafdar/ios-shortcuts](https://github.com/MalihaTarafdar/ios-shortcuts). If you found this shortcut useful, please consider supporting me at [coindrop.to/malihatarafdar](https://coindrop.to/malihatarafdar)!
